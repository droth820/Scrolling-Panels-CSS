# Scrolling-Panels-CSS
CSS Scrolling panel effect.

This project utilizes CSS to create a scrolling effect also known as parallaxing.

To create this project I created seven div containers and added an image to every other div. The second div contains the title, which appears to scroll up as you scroll down on the web page. Divs 4 and 6 are empty; however, as you can see in the CSS and HTML files, you can add text to them as well.

This project is in its initial development phase so feel free to make improvements. I stayed away from JavaScript on this one because I only wanted to take advantage of CSS effects. I used images from a vacation I took several years ago so they are not copyrighted.

One issue I am working through is that after the third div container, the scrolling effect is more difficult to maintain; however, it works very well with just the first three divs.

Instructions for use:
1. Either download onto your hard drive and run from you local browser or click Settings in the right-hand panel of the Git repository then select the URL.

2. Use your mouse to scroll through the beach scenes.
